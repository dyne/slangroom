Slangroom is a plugin system to enhance the domain-specific Zencode language, allowing to define custom operations to new sentences and making it easy to execute fast cryptographic operations on any data structure.

Zencode has a **no-code** approach. It is a domain-specific language (DSL) **similar to human language**. One can process large data structures through complex cryptographic and logical transformations.

Zencode helps developers to **empower people** who know what to do with data: one can write and review business logic and data-sensitive operations **without learning to code**.
